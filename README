0 Additional notes for the UFSCC extension
================================
The UFSCC algorithm has been implemented in the tool provided by Hong et al. [1].
The source code for this updated tool is available at:

    https://github.com/vbloemen/hong-ufscc

The installation procedure remains the same.

1 Introduction
================================
The scc-par parallel strongly connected components (SCC) algorithm [1] computes
all strongly connected components on a given input graph. It is optimized for 
small-world graphs, which are characterized by a low diameter and a large 
strongly-connected component on the order of the number of nodes. 

The C++ codes in scc-par assume the following libraries:

  * g++ (with builtin atomic functions)
  * g++ (with OpenMP support)
  * a custom graph library and runtime (gm_graph) 

The first two are supported by any recent g++ distributions (version 4.2 or higher); 
the third one is included in this source package.

2 Source Package
================================
The source code of scc-par is available as a zip file from:

    http://www.stanford.edu/~nrodia

It includes three main directories:

  * gm_graph -- the custom graph library and runtime
  * src -- the parallel SCC algorithm source files
  * tools -- the graph dataset format conversion tool

3 Compiling and Executing
================================
Compile the gm_graph runtime library and the scc binary by running make in the 
top-level directory. 

To execute scc-par, in the top-level directory, run:

./scc <graph_name> <num_threads> <method> {-d|-a|-p}

Calling ./scc with no input parameters will print the help, which describes
all of the options. 

Also included is a graph conversion utility to convert adjacency list or edge list
graph files into the binary format used by scc-par. To use this utility, you
will first need to download and install Green-Marl, available at:
    http://github.com/stanford-ppl/Green-Marl/

In the Makefile in the tools directory, set GM_TOP to the top-level Green-Marl
directory. To compile and print the help 
message for the conversion program, in the tools directory:

make
./convert -?
